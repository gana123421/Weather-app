Weather Forecast Web Application
This project is a responsive weather forecasting web application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information, a 5-day forecast, recent search history, and the option to fetch weather based on the user’s current location.
